## Data Insight and Business Recommendations

### 1. Category Performance Overview

**Overperforming brands:**

- **FRESHMIST** – Top profit despite moderate shelf space usage, low royalty and highest item average selling price
- **CLEANMATE** – High profit and top shelf space usage, but low royalty and profit margin
- **SHINEZ** – Top 2 in loyalty, profit margin, and shelf space usage brand; low item average selling price. **(Potential Brand)**

**Underperforming brands:**

- **SPARKLEAN, BIOBURST, ECOPOWER, PUREHOME** – Low profit and low margin despite occupying high shelf space usage and loyalty

**Performance variation across store clusters**

- **VALUE Cluster** – Highest total sales ($13.88M) and profit ($4.66M), largest store coverage (354 stores).
- **CORE Cluster** – Moderate sales ($11.88M) and profit ($3.92M), serving 302 stores.
- **UP Cluster** – Lowest total sales ($8.73M) and profit ($2.91M), smallest store base (208 stores). **Potential to overtake CORE Cluster performance if store base is expanded**

### 2. Range and Space Recommendations

- Remove underperforming products to improve category profitability.
- Improve navigation by re-organising layout to group high-demand product lines together.
- Maintain competitive pricing in the VALUE cluster while promoting in CORE and UP clusters.
- Leverage promotion events (e.g., Doctor Day - 10% off all ANTI-BACTERIAL segment products) using top brands or clearance (e.g., Golden Week -> 30% off all of BIOBURST brand products).
- Optimize the product range by removing underperforming products (this might limit consumer choice but can improve overall profitability and simplify shelf navigation).
- Allocate more space to high-margin products.
