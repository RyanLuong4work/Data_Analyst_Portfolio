## Competitor's Analysis (Market Research) Project

### 1. Overview

This project analyzes workforce data of 1,470 employees to understand **employee attrition (who leaves, why they leave, and which groups are most at risk)**. Instead of manually reviewing HR spreadsheets, this dashboard provides a **data-driven view of turnover patterns**, helping HR Managers improve employee retention strategies.

The dataset includes demographic attributes (age, gender, marital status), work conditions (overtime, job role, income, job satisfaction), and tenure information. With Power BI insights, managers can quickly **identify where turnover is highest and what actions can reduce future attrition**.

### 2. Business context:
#### 2.1 Overall

- Total leavers: 237

  - Human Resources: ~19.0%

- By job role (top risk):
  - Sales Representatives:  ~39.8%
  - Laboratory Technicians:  ~23.9%
 
#### 2.3 Who is most at risk?
- By age:
  - 18–25: ~35.8%
  - 26–30: ~21.3%
  - Older groups are much lower (about 10–14%)

- By tenure (Years at company):
  - 0–1 year: ~34–36%
  - It declines noticeably after 3–5 years
 
#### 2.4. Work conditions linked to attrition

  - No: ~10.4%

- Job satisfaction:
  - Satisfaction = 1 → ~22.8%
  - Satisfaction = 4 → ~11.3%

### 3. Business Recommendation
#### 3.1 Targeted retention in high-risk roles
- Prioritise Sales, Lab Technicians, and HR staff for retention programs.
- Review workload, career progression, and incentives for these roles.
- Consider role-specific stay interviews.

#### 3.2 Improve early-tenure experience (0–2 years)
- Strengthen onboarding, mentoring, and buddy programs.
- Implement check-ins at 3, 6, and 12 months for new hires.

#### 3.3 Logic/How can i track sold car
Because the websites don’t say directly “sold on this date”, I infer it from appearance/disappearance:
- Each **car is identified** by a unique combination of fields (all columns except crawl date).
- For each car, I track the **dates it appears** in the daily crawl -> If a car appears on multiple dates and then **stops appearing**, I treat that as sold car -> **The car was sold or removed on the date it disappeared**. Then i marked it in 'Sold' column and 'Sold Date' column will be first date it disappear.

#### 3.4 Focus on satisfaction drivers
- Low Job satisfaction or Environment satisfaction scores lead to high attrition rates.
- Partner with line managers to address issues (manager capability, team climate, recognition).

#### 3.5 Provide transportation to workplace
- Distance from home is one of the side impact leading to high attrition rate, both high income and low income group (combine ~900 employees) who live far from company (>10) achieved high attrition rate.
- Provide company bus/public transport/private transport for company staffs.
